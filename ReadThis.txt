To install the DreamHome wibsite examples, proceed as follows:

1. Run the Internet Information Server 
2. Create a new Website (virtual directory) with the root name DreamHome (if you choose to use a different name, it will still work but not 
with the web addresses shown in the text).  Take a note of the physical directory that houses the website from the website's properties.  
For example, this would be c:\inetpub\wwwroot\DreamHome for a standard installation of IIS or PWS.
3. Copy these files into the physical directory of the website.
4. Check the file properties for the database file DreamHome.mdb - make sure the file is not set for ReadOnly access (right-click on the file 
and select Properties - clear the ReadOnly check if need be).
5. Make sure the website is running (a start button is provided in both IIS and PWS).
6. In your web browser
http://localhost/DreamHome/index.asp to take you to the entry page of the website.
